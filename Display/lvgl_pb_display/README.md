# CMake LVGL Linux Framebuffer Example

Based on https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_linux_frame_buffer and crudely hacked together, but works for my purposes and might be a starting point for other people too. (As I'm not very familiar with CMake and lvgl it took me quite some time until it worked at all).

Run with `cmake CMakeLists.txt && make -j 8`
